# Hello there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

My name is **Diego Enrique**. I am a Computer Science undergraduate 
student at Universidade Federal de Goiás (<a href="https://www.ufg.br/">UFG</a>) in Goiânia, Brazil.
I enjoy learning more about management and data, and I believe 
that data-driven applications can bring greater ease to the
lives of people and businesses.

#### Other things about me:

- 🌱 I am currently learning more about data, data visualization, and management. I am also looking to improve my English skills.

- 🤔 I am also looking for help with the subjects above. Anything could be helpful.

- 🍿 You can ask me about Movies. Watching movies is my hobby, and I like to talk about it.
